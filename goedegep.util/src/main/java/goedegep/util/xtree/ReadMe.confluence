h3. changeTreeType(XTreeType newTreeType)
For now I don't have it, as it doesn't fit with OO.
Instead of changeTreeType you make a copy with a new type, e.g.:
AsciiSerializedXtree aTree;
DefaultMutableXTree dTree = new DefaultMutableXTree(aTree)

This may change if I introduce hybrid tree (e.g. a mutable tree with part in binary).
