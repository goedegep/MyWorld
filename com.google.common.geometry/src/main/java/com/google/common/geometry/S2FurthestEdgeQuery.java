/**
 * {@link S2FurthestEdgeQuery} is a helper class for searching within an {@link S2ShapeIndex} to
 * find the furthest edge(s) to a given target point, edge, S2Cell, or {@link ShapeIndex geometry
 * collection}. Furthest edges are those with maximum distance from any point on that edge to any
 * point on the target geometry.
 *
 * <p>For example, given a set of polylines, the following code efficiently finds the furthest 100
 * polyline edges from a query target point that are at least 10 kilometers from it, and then finds
 * the single furthest polyline edge from a second target ShapeIndex.
 *
 * <p>This example code demonstrates the use of the provided convenience methods for working with
 * S2FurthestEdgeQuery using an S1Distance abstract type that is specifically S1ChordAngle. This is
 * recommended for most clients.
 *
 * <pre>{@code

class FurthestEdgeDemo {
  // Recommended: S2Earth.toAngle(new Length.Kilometers(10))
  static final S1Angle MIN_DISTANCE = S1Angle.fromEarthDistance(10000);

  public static void example(
      List<S2Polyline> polylines, S2ShapeIndex targetIndex, S2Point targetPoint) {
    // Add the given polylines to a shape index.
    S2ShapeIndex polylinesIndex = new S2ShapeIndex();
    for (S2Polyline polyline : polylines) {
      polylinesIndex.add(S2LaxPolylineShape.create(polyline));
    }

    // Create a Builder, modifying the default values with a minimum distance and maximum number
    // of results.
    S2FurthestEdgeQuery.Builder builder =
        S2FurthestEdgeQuery.builder().setInclusiveMinDistance(MIN_DISTANCE).setMaxResults(100);

    // Construct the query. Note that "Query" extends S2FurthestEdgeQuery<S1ChordAngle>.
    S2FurthestEdgeQuery.Query query = builder.build(polylinesIndex);

    // Create a target that is a single point.
    S2FurthestEdgeQuery.PointTarget<S1ChordAngle> pointTarget =
        new S2FurthestEdgeQuery.PointTarget<>(targetPoint);

    // Find and visit up to 100 polyline edges in polylinesIndex that are the farthest from the
    // target point, and at least 10 km from it.
    query.findFurthestEdges(
        pointTarget,
        (S1ChordAngle distance, S2Shape shape, int edgeId) -> {
          // Do something with each of these furthest edge results.
          return true;
        });

    // Create a target that is another shapeIndex.
    S2FurthestEdgeQuery.ShapeIndexTarget<S1ChordAngle> shapeIndexTarget =
        S2FurthestEdgeQuery.createShapeIndexTarget(targetIndex);
    shapeIndexTarget.setIncludeInteriors(true);

    // Find the single farthest polyline edge to any edge or polygon interior in the
    // ShapeIndexTarget, if any matches the query options, i.e. at least 10000 meters.
    Optional<S2BestEdgesQueryBase.Result<S1ChordAngle>> result =
        query.findFurthestEdge(shapeIndexTarget);

    // If the result.isPresent() it contains distance(), shape(), and edgeId().
    if (result.isPresent()) {
      // Get the actual furthest polyline edge endpoints from the Result shape and edge id.
      S2Shape.MutableEdge edge = new S2Shape.MutableEdge();
      S2ClosestEdgeQuery.getEdge(result.get(), edge);
      // Do something with the edge endpoints.
    }
  }
}

 * }</pre>
 *
 * Query options are immutable and are set on the Builder, which is then used to construct queries
 * as shown in the example above. To find the furthest edges from a query edge rather than a point,
 * use:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * S2FurthestEdgeQuery.EdgeTarget<S1ChordAngle> target
 *     = new S2FurthestEdgeQuery.EdgeTarget<>(v0, v1);
 * query.findFurthestEdges(target);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Similarly you can find the furthest edges from an S2Cell by using a
 * {@link S2FurthestEdgeQuery.CellTarget}, and you can find the furthest edges from an arbitrary
 * collection of points, polylines, and polygons by using an
 * {@link S2FurthestEdgeQuery.ShapeIndexTarget}.
 *
 * <p>There are two overloads of the findFurthestEdges() method:
 * <ol>
 *   <li> Users may simply get a returned list of Result objects. However, for cases where many
 *        calls to findFurthestEdges will be made for a single query, the alternative can be much
 *        more efficient.
 *   <li> Users may instead provide a ResultVisitor that accepts (distance, shape, edge id) tuples
 *        This avoids boxing values, but it does fully compute the set of results before any are
 *        visited.
 * </ol>
 *
 * The {@link Result} object contains the following accessors:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link Result#distance()} is the distance to the edge.
 *   <li>{@link Result#shape()} is the S2Shape containing the edge.
 *   <li>{@link Result#edgeId()} identifies the edge with the given shape.
 *   <li>{@link Result#isInterior()} indicates that the result is an interior point.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The following convenience method may also be useful:
 * {@link S2FurthestEdgeQuery#getEdge(Result, MutableEdge)} fills the MutableEdge with the endpoints
 * of the Result edge.
 *
 * <p>You can find either the k furthest edges, or all edges no closer than a given radius, or both
 * (i.e., the k furthest edges no closer than a given minimum radius). E.g. to find all the edges
 * further than 5 kilometers, call:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * options.setMinDistance(S2Earth.toAngle(new Length.Kilometers(5)));
 * }</pre
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * By default, *all* edges are returned, so you should always specify either maxResults() or
 * minDistance() or both. Setting min distance may not be very restrictive, so strongly consider
 * using maxResults().There is also a findFurthestEdge() convenience method that returns only the
 * single furthest edge.
 *
 * <p>Note that by default, distances are measured to the boundary and interior of polygons. For
 * example, if a point is inside a polygon then its distance is zero. To change this behavior,
 * setIncludeInteriors(false) when building the query options.
 *
 * <p>If you only need to test whether the distance is above a given threshold (e.g., 10 km), you
 * can use the isDistanceGreater() method. This is much faster than actually calculating the
 * distance with findFurthestEdge(), since the implementation can stop as soon as it can prove that
 * the maximum distance is either above or below the threshold.
 *
 * <p>The implementation is designed to be fast for both simple and complex geometric objects.
