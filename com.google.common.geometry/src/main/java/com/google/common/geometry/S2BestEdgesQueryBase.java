/**
 * S2BestEdgesQueryBase is an abstract class for finding the best edge(s) between two geometries. It
 * is not intended to be used directly, but rather to serve as the core implementation for various
 * specialized classes with more convenient APIs, such as S2ClosestEdgeQuery, which define what
 * "Best" means, and what kind of S1Distance is used for measuring distance.
 *
 * <p>It is flexible enough to be adapted to compute maximum distances and even potentially
 * Hausdorff distances. By using the appropriate options, implementations can answer questions such
 * as:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Find the minimum or maximum distance between two geometries A and B.
 *   <li>Find all edges of geometry A that are within a given distance 'd' of geometry B.
 *   <li>Find all edges of geometry A that are more than a given distance 'd' from geometry B.
 *   <li>Find the 'k' edges of geometry A that are closest to, or farthest from a given point P.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>You can also specify whether polygons should include their interiors (i.e., if a target point
 * is contained by an indexed polygon, should the distance be zero or should it be measured to the
 * polygon boundary?)
 *
 * <p>The input geometries may consist of any number of points, polylines, and polygons
 * (collectively referred to as "shapes"). Shapes do not need to be disjoint; they may overlap or
 * intersect arbitrarily. The implementation is designed to be fast for both simple and complex
 * geometries.
 *
 * <p>The S1Distance template argument defines the representation of distances. Usually it is
 * S1ChordAngle, but another implementation of the S1Distance interface may be used.
 *
 * <p>There are two versions of the findBestEdges() method. Users can simply get a List of Result
 * objects, but for cases where many calls to findBestEdges will be made for a single query, the
 * alternative can be much more efficient, as Results will be reused internally. Instead of
 * obtaining Result objects, clients provide a ResultVisitor that accepts (distance, shape, edge id)
 * tuples.
