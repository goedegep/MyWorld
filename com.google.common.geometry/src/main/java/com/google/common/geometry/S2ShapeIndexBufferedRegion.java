/**
 * This class provides a way to expand an arbitrary collection of geometry by a fixed radius (an
 * operation variously known as "buffering", "offsetting", or "Minkowski sum with a disc") in order
 * to compute an S2CellId covering (see S2RegionCoverer). The resulting covering contains all points
 * within the given radius of any point in the original geometry.
 *
 * <p>This class does not actually buffer the geometry; instead it implements the S2Region API by
 * computing the distance from candidate S2CellIds to the original geometry. If this distance is
 * below the given radius then the S2CellId intersects the buffered geometry. For example, if the
 * original geometry consists of a single S2Point then the buffered geometry is exactly equivalent
 * to an S2Cap with the given radius. (Note that the region is not approximated as a polygonal
 * loop.)
 *
 * <p>Example usage:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * S2CellUnion getBufferedCovering(S2ShapeIndex index, S1Angle radius) {
 *   S2ShapeIndexBufferedRegion region = new S2ShapeIndexBufferedRegion(index, radius);
 *   S2CellUnion covering = S2RegionCoverer.DEFAULT.getCovering(region);
 *   return covering;
 * }
 *
 * }</pre>
