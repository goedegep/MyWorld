/**
 * Implementation of {@link S2IndexingHelper}. See the documentation of that class for a description
 * of the problem being addressed.
 *
 * <p>Since S2 cells are hierarchical, a cell intersects only with itself, its ancestors, and its
 * descendants. This fundamental principle is at the basis of this algorithm.
 *
 * <p>RULE 1: The conceptually simplest approach is as follows. Given the covering of a document
 * region:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>we index each cell as a covering term; and
 *   <li>we index each ancestor of each cell as an ancestor term.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>To perform a search given the covering of a query region, we combine the following result
 * sets:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>we find all the document regions which intersect because a query cell is the same as a
 *       document cell, by looking up each cell as a covering term;
 *   <li>we find all the document regions which intersect because a query cell is an ancestor of a
 *       document cell, by looking up each cell as an ancestor term; and
 *   <li>we find all the document regions which intersect because a query cell is a descendent of a
 *       document cell (i.e. because a document cell is an ancestor of a query cell), by looking up
 *       each ancestor of each cell as a covering term.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>We refer to this approach as 'optimize for space', by contrast with the following variant.
 *
 * <p>RULE 2: An alternative approach indexes each cell in the covering of a document region as an
 * ancestor term as well as indexing it as a covering term. This means that the first of the three
 * lookups above is not necessary, because it is subsumed by the second. That is, given the covering
 * of a document region:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>we index each cell as both a covering term and an ancestor term; and
 *   <li>we index each ancestor of each cell as an ancestor term.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>To perform a search given the covering of a query region:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>we find all the document regions which intersect because a query cell is the same as or an
 *       ancestor of a document cell, by looking up each cell as an ancestor term; and
 *   <li>we find all the document regions which intersect because a query cell is an descendent of a
 *       document cell, by looking up each ancestor of each cell as a covering term.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This variant increases the size of the index and reduces the complexity of the queries. So we
 * to this approach as 'optimize for complexity', by contrast with the previous 'optimize for space'
 * approach.
 *
 * <p>RULE 3: A leaf cell (i.e. one at the maximum level we are dealing with) will never be the
 * ancestor of another cell. ` *
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>In 'optimize for complexity' mode, where we would normally index a covering cell in a
 *       document region as both a covering term and an ancestor term, we can safely index a leaf
 *       covering cell only as an ancestor term. This reduces the index size without causing any
 *       change in the query or results from the search.
 *   <li>In 'optimize for space' mode, where we would normally index a covering cell in a document
 *       region as a covering term, we can safely index a leaf covering cell as either a covering
 *       cell or an ancestor cell, without causing any change in the query or results. We choose to
 *       index it as an ancestor cell, to make subsequent optimizations possible.
 *   <li>In 'optimize for space' mode, where we would normally look up a covering cell in a query
 *       region as both a covering term and an ancestor term, we can safely look up a leaf covering
 *       cell only as an ancestor term. This reduces the query complexity without causing any change
 *       in the results.
 *   <li>In 'optimize for complexity' mode, we continue to look up a leaf cell as an ancestor term.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>RULE 4: A point is most accurately represented by the single leaf cell which covers it. We can
 * see from rules 1, 2, and 3 that we will index this leaf cell and all its ancestors as ancestor
 * terms. This is the case whether we are in 'optimize for space' or 'optimize for complexity' mode.
 * Note that we create no covering terms.
 *
 * <p>RULE 5: If we know that only points have been indexed (as their leaf cells), rule 4 shows that
 * the index will contain no covering terms. Therefore, we can safely omit all covering terms from
 * the lookups.
 *
 * <p>RULE 6: A point is most accurately represented by the single leaf cell which covers it. We can
 * see from rules 1, 2, and 3 that we will search for this by looking up the leaf cell as an
 * ancestor term and looking up all its ancestors as covering terms. This is the case whether we are
 * in 'optimize for space' or 'optimize for complexity' mode.
 *
 * <p>This class is thread-safe. However, this is achieved through synchronization of the
 * calculation of coverings, so if you need high throughput from concurrent usage of the methods
 * which take {@link S2Region}s then you should consider thread-local instances. The {@link Builder}
 * class is thread-unsafe.
