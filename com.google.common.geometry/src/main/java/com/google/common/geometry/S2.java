/**
 * The S2 class is simply a namespace for constants and static utility functions related to
 * spherical geometry, such as area calculations and edge intersection tests. The name "S2" is
 * derived from the mathematical symbol for the two-dimensional unit sphere (note that the "2"
 * refers to the dimension of the surface, not the space it is embedded in).
 *
 * <p>This class also defines a framework for decomposing the unit sphere into a hierarchy of
 * "cells". Each cell is a quadrilateral bounded by four geodesics. The top level of the hierarchy
 * is obtained by projecting the six faces of a cube onto the unit sphere, and lower levels are
 * obtained by subdividing each cell into four children recursively.
 *
 * <p>This file also contains documentation of the various coordinate systems and conventions used.
 * TODO(torrey): Fix this link after Copybara migration is done.
 * For more details, see go s2.

  // There are several notions of the "centroid" of a triangle. First, there is the planar
  // centroid, which is simply the centroid of the ordinary (non-spherical) triangle defined by the
  // three vertices. Second, there is the surface centroid, which is defined as the intersection of
  // the three medians of the spherical triangle. It is possible to show that this point is simply
  // the planar centroid projected to the surface of the sphere. Finally, there is the true
  // centroid (mass centroid), which is defined as the surface integral over the spherical triangle
  // of (x,y,z) divided by the triangle area. This is the point that the triangle would rotate
  // around if it was spinning in empty space.
  //
  // The best centroid for most purposes is the true centroid. Unlike the planar and surface
  // centroids, the true centroid behaves linearly as regions are added or subtracted. That is, if
  // you split a triangle into pieces and compute the average of their centroids (weighted by
  // triangle area), the result equals the centroid of the original triangle. This is not true of
  // the other centroids.
  //
  // Also note that the surface centroid may be nowhere near the intuitive "center" of a spherical
  // triangle. For example, consider the triangle with vertices A=(1,eps,0), B=(0,0,1),
  // C=(-1,eps,0) (a quarter-sphere). The surface centroid of this triangle is at S=(0, 2*eps, 1),
  // which is within a distance of 2*eps of the vertex B. Note that the median from A (the segment
  // connecting A to the midpoint of BC) passes through S, since this is the shortest path
  // connecting the two endpoints. On the other hand, the true centroid is at M=(0, 0.5, 0.5),
  // which when projected onto the surface is a much more reasonable interpretation of the "center"
  // of this triangle.
