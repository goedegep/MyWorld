    // It is surprisingly difficult to compute the area of a loop robustly. The main issues are (1)
    // whether degenerate loops are considered to be CCW or not (i.e., whether their area is close
    // to 0 or 4*Pi), and (2) computing the areas of small loops with good relative accuracy.
    //
    // With respect to degeneracies, we would like getArea() to be consistent with
    // S2Loop.contains(S2Point) in that loops that contain many points should have large areas, and
    // loops that contain few points should have small areas. For example, if a degenerate triangle
    // is considered CCW according to S2Predicates.sign(), then it will contain very few points and
    // its area should be approximately zero. On the other hand if it is considered clockwise, then
    // it will contain virtually all points and so its area should be approximately 4*Pi.
    //
    // More precisely, let U be the set of S2Points for which S2.isUnitLength() is true, let P(U) be
    // the projection of those points onto the mathematical unit sphere, and let V(P(U)) be the
    // Voronoi diagram of the projected points. Then for every loop x, we would like GetArea() to
    // approximately equal the sum of the areas of the Voronoi regions of the points p for which
    // x.Contains(p) is true.
    //
    // The second issue is that we want to compute the area of small loops accurately. This
    // requires having good relative precision rather than good absolute precision. For example, if
    // the area of a loop is 1e-12 and the error is 1e-15, then the area only has 3 digits of
    // accuracy. (For reference, 1e-12 is about 40 square meters on the surface of the earth.) We
    // would like to have good relative accuracy even for small loops.
    //
    // To achieve these goals, we combine two different methods of computing the area. This first
    // method is based on the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, which says that the area enclosed by the loop
    // equals 2*Pi minus the total geodesic curvature of the loop (i.e., the sum of the "turning
    // angles" at all the loop vertices). The big advantage of this method is that as long as we
    // use S2Predicates.sign() to compute the turning angle at each vertex, then degeneracies are
    // always handled correctly. In other words, if a degenerate loop is CCW according to the
    // symbolic perturbations used by S2Predicates.sign(), then its turning angle will be
    // approximately 2*Pi.
    //
    // The disadvantage of the Gauss-Bonnet method is that its absolute error is about 2e-15 times
    // the number of vertices (see GetCurvatureMaxError). So, it cannot compute the area of small
    // loops accurately.
    //
    // The second method is based on splitting the loop into triangles and summing the area of each
    // triangle. To avoid the difficulty and expense of decomposing the loop into a union of non-
    // overlapping triangles, instead we compute a signed sum over triangles that may overlap (see
    // the comments for S2ShapeUtil.visitSurfaceIntegral). The advantage of this method is that the
    // area of each triangle can be computed with much better relative accuracy (using l'Huilier's
    // theorem). The disadvantage is that the result is a signed area: CCW loops may yield a small
    // positive value, while CW loops may yield a small negative value (which is converted to a
    // positive area by adding 4*Pi). This means that small errors in computing the signed area may
    // translate into a very large error in the result (if the sign of the sum is incorrect).
    //
    // So, our strategy is to combine these two methods as follows. First we compute the area using
    // the "signed sum over triangles" approach (since it is generally more accurate). We also
    // estimate the maximum error in this result. If the signed area is too close to zero (i.e.,
    // zero is within the error bounds), then we double-check the sign of the result using the
    // Gauss-Bonnet method. If the two methods disagree, we return the smallest possible positive
    // or negative area based on the result of GetCurvature(). Otherwise we return the area that we
    // computed originally.
