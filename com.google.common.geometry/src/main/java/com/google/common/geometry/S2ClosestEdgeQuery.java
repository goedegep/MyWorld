/**
 * {@link S2ClosestEdgeQuery} is a helper class for searching within an {@link S2ShapeIndex} to find
 * the closest edge(s) to a given target point, edge, s2 cell, or {@link ShapeIndex geometry
 * collection}. Closest edges are those with minimum distance from any point on that edge to any
 * point on the target geometry.
 *
 * <p>For example, given a set of polylines, the following code efficiently finds up to the closest
 * 100 edges of those polylines to a query target point, and at most 5km from it. Then, the single
 * polyline edge closest to any edge in a second target ShapeIndex is found.
 *
 * <p>This example code demonstrates the use of the provided convenience methods for working with
 * S2ClosestEdgeQuery using an S1Distance abstract type that is specifically S1ChordAngle. This is
 * recommended for most clients.
 *
 * <pre>{@code

class ClosestEdgeDemo {
  // Recommended: S2Earth.toAngle(new Length.Kilometers(5));
  static final S1Angle MAX_DISTANCE = S1Angle.fromEarthDistance(5000);

  public static void example(
      List<S2Polyline> polylines, S2ShapeIndex targetIndex, S2Point targetPoint) {
    // Add the given polylines to a shape index.
    S2ShapeIndex polylinesIndex = new S2ShapeIndex();
    for (S2Polyline polyline : polylines) {
      polylinesIndex.add(S2LaxPolylineShape.create(polyline));
    }

    // Create a Builder, modifying the default values with a maximum distance and number of
    // results.
    S2ClosestEdgeQuery.Builder builder =
        S2ClosestEdgeQuery.builder().setInclusiveMaxDistance(MAX_DISTANCE).setMaxResults(100);

    // Construct the query.
    S2ClosestEdgeQuery.Query query = builder.build(polylinesIndex);

    // Create a target that is a single point.
    S2ClosestEdgeQuery.PointTarget<S1ChordAngle> pointTarget =
        new S2ClosestEdgeQuery.PointTarget<>(targetPoint);

    // Find and visit up to 100 polyline edges in polylinesIndex that are the closest to the
    // target point, and at most 5 km from it.
    query.findClosestEdges(
        pointTarget,
        (S1ChordAngle distance, S2Shape shape, int edgeId) -> {
          // Do something with each of these closest edge results.
          return true;
        });

    // Create a target that is another shapeIndex.
    S2ClosestEdgeQuery.ShapeIndexTarget<S1ChordAngle> shapeIndexTarget =
        S2ClosestEdgeQuery.createShapeIndexTarget(targetIndex);
    shapeIndexTarget.setIncludeInteriors(true);

    // Find the single closest polyline edge to any edge or polygon interior in the
    // shapeIndexTarget, if any matches the query options, i.e. at most 5000 meters.
    Optional<S2BestEdgesQueryBase.Result<S1ChordAngle>> result =
        query.findClosestEdge(shapeIndexTarget);

    // If the result.isPresent(), it contains distance(), shape(), and edgeId().
    if (result.isPresent()) {
      // Get the actual closest polyline edge endpoints from the Result shape and edge id.
      S2Shape.MutableEdge edge = new S2Shape.MutableEdge();
      S2ClosestEdgeQuery.getEdge(result.get(), edge);
      // Use the edge endpoints.
    }
  }
}

 * }</pre>
 * Query options are immutable and are set on the Builder, which is then used to construct queries
 * as shown in the example above. To find the closest edges to a query edge rather than a point,
 * use:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * S2ClosestEdgeQuery.EdgeTarget<S1ChordAngle> target = new S2ClosestEdgeQuery.EdgeTarget<>(v0, v1);
 * query.findClosestEdges(target);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Similarly you can find the closest edges to an S2Cell by using a
 * {@link S2ClosestEdgeQuery.CellTarget}, and you can find the closest edges to an arbitrary
 * collection of points, polylines, and polygons by using an
 * {@link S2ClosestEdgeQuery.ShapeIndexTarget}.
 *
 * <p>There are two overloads of the findClosestEdges() method:
 * <ol>
 *   <li> Users may simply get a returned list of Result objects. However, for cases where many
 *        calls to findClosestEdges will be made for a single query, the alternative can be much
 *        more efficient.
 *   <li> Users may instead provide a ResultVisitor that accepts (distance, shape, edge id) tuples.
 *        This avoids boxing values, but it does fully compute the set of results before any are
 *        visited.
 * </ol>
 *
 * The {@link Result} object contains the following accessors:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link Result#distance()} is the distance to the edge.
 *   <li>{@link Result#shape()} is the S2Shape containing the edge.
 *   <li>{@link Result#edgeId()} identifies the edge with the given shape.
 *   <li>{@link Result#isInterior()} indicates that the result is an interior point.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The following convenience methods may also be useful:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link S2ClosestEdgeQuery#getEdge(Result, MutableEdge)} fills the MutableEdge with the
 *       endpoints of the Result edge.
 *   <li>{@link S2ClosestEdgeQuery#project(S2Point, Result)} computes the closest point on the
 *       Result edge to the given S2Point.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>You can find either the k closest edges, or all edges within a given radius, or both (i.e.,
 * the k closest edges up to a given maximum radius). E.g. to find all the edges within 5
 * kilometers, call
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * options.setMaxDistance(S2Earth.toAngle(new Length.Kilometers(5)));
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>By default, *all* edges are returned, so you should always specify either maxResults() or
 * maxDistance() or both. There is also a findClosestEdge() convenience method that returns only the
 * single closest edge.
 *
 * <p>Note that by default, distances are measured to the boundary and interior of polygons. For
 * example, if a point is inside a polygon then its distance is zero. To change this behavior,
 * setIncludeInteriors(false) when building the query options.
 *
 * <p>If you only need to test whether the distance is below a given threshold (e.g., 10 km), you
 * can use the isDistanceLess() method. This is much faster than actually calculating the distance
 * with findClosestEdge(), since the implementation can stop as soon as it can prove that the
 * minimum distance is either above or below the threshold.
 *
 * <p>The implementation is designed to be fast for both simple and complex geometric objects.
