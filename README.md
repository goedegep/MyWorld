# MyWorld
A Java application to support the things I do on a PC; vacations, media, invoices and properties, and more

This project is under construction.

## Documentation
Documentation about this application can be found on [MyDigitalLife](https://petersdigitallife.nl/).

## Imported libraries
I've added external library projects to my project for a number of reasons:
- To make some modifications
- To learn from the code
- Easy debugging
For these external libraries I probably didn't follow the right rules related to the licenses. I appologize for that.
